Some things you might like to know to run trinity like a pro(tm).

- The kernel is pretty noisy in some areas. You might find that it's
  worthwhile to remove a bunch of the noisier printk/WARN statements
  in your kernel tree while fuzzing.

- Likewise, setting the sysctl net.core.warnings = 0 may be a good idea.
