[IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) is one of the more powerful and useful disassemblers. However, it's not easy to get a copy with arm64 support at this time, and is also quite pricey.

[Hopper](http://www.hopperapp.com) is a great disassembler, albeit missing some of the features which make IDA has. Quite affordable for the average person, and demo is very useful as well. 

Hopefully going to get [qira](https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/qira) working on iOS. Would be incredibly useful for analysis.
